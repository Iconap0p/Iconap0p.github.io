            <span>DEF CON 33: Why it Matters</span>

    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">DEF CON 33 - Why I valued this year more than previous years…</h3>

    <p>I want to say, I believe this year I was heavily involved in participating and trying new things at DEF CON. In previous years, I was more of an observer. I would watch someone do it first, then try it. It was repetitive like that the last two years I went.</p>

    <p>First, I think I attended DEF CON with a completely new mindset. After taking a year off, it gave me some space mentally and physically from the frustrations of struggling with CTFs #n00b. But when I walked into the convention and saw hackable cameras, boats, drones… I just wanted to try it all!!</p>

    <p>Secondly, I think my biggest flaw but also my biggest success was staying out late… til 5 a.m. (three nights in a row). Obviously, to hack and do shenanigans, there was just no way around it. Maybe I was running on adrenaline and some imaginary energy I still had left in me. But I still followed the regular 3-2-1 DEF CON Rule (sleep for at least 3 hours, eat twice, and shower once a day).</p>

    <p>I got to make my first set of stickers this year — which was pretty exciting. And, of course, I gained popularity over those as well.</p>

    <p>I talked my way into a ton of parties, met a ton of cool people, and some very well-known celebrities in our community. It was truly awe-inspiring to hear their personal stories, their tragedies, and their victories.</p>

    <p>I feel that every time I attend DEF CON, I not only learn a lot but also gain different perspectives of hacking from various viewpoints. I met tons of CISOs and CEOs, hackers leading in industries of security consulting, and even a number of SANS writers.</p>

    <h4 class="h6">System Embedding Village</h4>
    <p>This one was nice to walk into. As someone that manages vulnerabilities, I was pretty curious as to which CVSS scores I would encounter for an exploit. For this particular camera, the buffer overflow used custom firmware that this company specifically made to exploit these cameras. However, the practice of going step-by-step was nonetheless helpful. Exploiting hardware can be tricky, as sometimes there are multiple devices or systems connected to one. I think I did this one three times.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Running Recon Tools:</strong> Finding the vulnerable machine on the network and running nmap to enumerate hosts and identify the target device running the camera application.</li>
      <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Due to the script being available, this wasn’t necessary, but usually, some research on how to exploit firmware is done before the attack. The buffer overflow script was given to us already. After visiting the IP, we saw that we needed to have some form of privilege.</li>
      <li><strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> After identifying the vulnerable system, we sent a buffer overflow to the affected device. The script manipulates the coding error to carry out malicious actions and compromise the affected device. It alters an application’s execution path and overwrites the memory element, exposing the execution path of the program to damage or data exposure. This script was obviously made specifically to exploit this device.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>From here, we accessed the affected device (through the buffer overflow) and retrieved the unencrypted admin/password.</p>

    <h4 class="h6">Maritime Village — Day 1</h4>
    <p>This village was crazy!! Drug boats? Crate locks? A Coast Guard cruise boat? And a 20-month-old autonomous surface vessel (you had to provide proof of passport to participate in the CTF)?? And where are the H03s?? (Jk)</p>

    <p>I will say, compared to other villages, the volunteers here were EAGER to talk to you. “Come check this out!” “Wanna know what this boat was?” “Check out our CTF.” They were beyond patient in answering ridiculous questions and loaning equipment. I think I asked the same question five times.</p>

    <p>As much as I wanted to participate, I was severely unprepared. No ethernet dongle, no VM downloaded (nothing adaptable to ARM), and above all, I was mentally struggling after only having three hours of sleep for three days straight.</p>

    <p>So here we go — side quest for hunting down an ethernet dongle and ethernet cord.</p>

    <p>After stumbling across three celebrity goons and several familiar faces from the FloridaMan party, I finally stumbled across the RF Village — obviously someone there was going to have an extra. After chatting with the head organizer, offering some stickers for bribery, and having a quick discussion about what I wanted to accomplish, he agreed to loan me the ethernet dongle.</p>

    <p>Heading back to the Maritime Village, I decided to give the HavocAI CTF a try. I plugged into the network and tried to see what I could find…</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recon:</strong> NMAP on the IP range I was on</li>
      <li><strong>Realization:</strong> Oh shit, what am I looking at..?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AFS port 7000 was open, along with some 3000 port of UPnP, and a red light blinking on rotation.</p>

    <p><strong>AFS — Andrew File System</strong> is a distributed file system (dating back to the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University), allowing many computers on a network to share files easily, without worrying where the physical file was. This made sense — it was popular among academia. It was efficient to share a file among several different computers.</p>

    <p>This file server was listening on UDP port 7000, which is responsible for handling and retrieving actual file data within the AFS structure.</p>

    <p><strong>UPnP — Universal Plug ’n’ Play</strong> is a set of network protocols that enables devices on the same local network to easily discover, connect, and communicate without manual configuration. Think of media sharing, smart home integration, gaming, and VoIP. I can’t quite remember this one because I didn’t delve into it.</p>

    <p>By that time, it was the end of the first day of the con.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Maritime Village — Day 2</h4>
    <p>We thought we’d give the HavocAI a break and decided to try out the drug boat. This one was involving.</p>

    <p>When I plugged into the device, I did see the PCAN protocol populate through USB.</p>

    <p>First, you had to plug into the PCAN. Yes, PCAN is essentially the Peak CAN (Controller Area Network) interface used for automotive or industrial settings. And the NMEA 2000 is the marine networking standard built on the CAN protocol.</p>

    <p>This required some software to read the PEAK-CAN maritime protocols. So we downloaded the open-source Canboat to identify and pull the serial of the drug boat.</p>

    <p>From there, we were able to see the state of PCAN, which was “DOWN.” So we sent a command to make the network say “UP.” From here, we could now listen to the traffic of the drug boat. So — like any n00b — we captured some signal and performed a replay attack. That was pretty exciting.</p>

    <p>And to know that this simple n00b attack worked — it was shocking to learn how many boats are equipped with NMEA2000 networks, including this little drug boat. Weaknesses in network protocols could make a n00b like me capture some signal and perform a replay attack, possibly manipulating navigational devices and leading to incorrect readings. This could also lead to denial-of-service attacks and spoofing, which, in the sense of a boat, would mean falsifying the vessel’s speed data.</p>

    <p>NMEA 2000 is known for its weak authentication and lack of encrypted communication over the network.</p>

    <p>All to say, I learned so much at this village. If I didn’t have human body functions and was simply a plant that could survive through photosynthesis, I could probably spend multiple days in this village. I was bummed to find out by the end of the second day that the villages on the third day were basically closed (which makes sense).</p>

    <p>Now you must be wondering if I ever returned that ethernet dongle?? The answer is YES. And actually, the organizer of the RF Village has invited me to join their crew on Discord.</p>

    <p>He thought I gave them a random@ss sticker (that wasn’t my own, which — tbh — offended me), but after googling my name realized I was indeed REAL. So I will forever be known as the ‘Dongle Stealer.’</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Day 3 — End of the Con</h4>
    <p>I had training this day. I got to make a cool multi-RF tool that can jam Wi-Fi and BLE. They also provided the firmware for taking out drones, but I figure I’d test that another day…</p>

    <p>The trainer of this course worked with Ukrainian troops. He shared his inspiring story of traveling to the front lines and offering his services of RF hacking to Ukrainians, including writing custom firmware for the RF tools we were going to be messing with.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Key Takeaways and How I Will Apply Them</h4>

    <p><strong>1) Technical Growth:</strong> I now better understand how weak authentication and unencrypted communications can be exploited, and how this knowledge applies to vulnerability management in my daily role. Although this may not directly affect it, seeing these weaknesses visually demonstrated showed me how critical weak encryption can be — especially in OT systems like IP cameras, badge scanners, or conference room AV setups that often run outdated TLS, default credentials, or even cleartext traffic. These experiences will help me build better reconnaissance strategies and execute more effective vulnerability assessments.</p>

    <p><strong>2) Networking &amp; Community:</strong> Attending these events helps build connections with industry experts, hackers, and security leaders, expanding my professional network and creating more opportunities for future collaborations. Hearing firsthand experiences from CISOs, SANS authors, and researchers gave me new perspectives on scaling and prioritizing risk, as well as fostering innovation.</p>

    <p><strong>3) Mindset:</strong> This year, I stopped waiting and decided to jump straight into the challenge, which taught me to trust my skills and adapt quickly.</p>

    <p><strong>4) Prepping and Planning:</strong> I learned the importance of coming prepared — with the right hardware, VMs, and dongles set up — so I can maximize my time learning and experimenting. Also, realizing the importance of saying “NO” to brain juice. You may be wondering what that is — but considering it’s DEF CON, I was offered this, and I’ll just leave it up to your imagination.</p>
