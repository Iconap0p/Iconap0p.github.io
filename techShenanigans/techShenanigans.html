    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">DEF CON 33 - Why I valued this year more than previous years…</h3>

<p>This year, I was all in at DEF CON, like really participating and trying new things. In past years, I’d been more of an observer. I’d hang back, watch someone else do it first, and then give it a try.</p>

<p>Taking a year off gave me time to reset. It gave me space, both mentally and physically, to shake off the frustrations of struggling through the endles-ingestion of security research.</p> 

<p>This year, when I walked into the convention and saw hackable cameras, boats, drones — you name it — my first thought was, I wanted to try it all.</p>

<p>Staying out until 5 a.m. three nights in a row probably wasn’t my wisest decision — but honestly, it led to some of my best experiences. To hack, network, and dive into shenanigans, you’ve got to push the limits a little. I’m pretty sure I was running on nothing but adrenaline and some imaginary energy reserve. Still, I stuck to the 3–2–1 DEF CON rule: sleep at least 3 hours, eat 2 meals, and shower once a day.</p>

<p>I also made my first set of stickers this year, which was exciting — and handing them out was the easiest icebreaker ever. I made friends fast.</p>

<p>Between that and talking my way into a ton of parties, I met so many incredible people — including some of the most well-known figures in our community. Listening to their stories, hearing about their wins and hard-learned lessons, was honestly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Every time I go to DEF CON, I leave with new skills and fresh perspectives. What I love most, though, is seeing hacking through so many different lenses — from CISOs and CEOs to security researchers and SANS writers. This year was no exception.</p>

    <h4 class="h6">System Embedding Village - Day 1</h4>
    <p>This one was refreshing to dive into. As someone who manages vulnerabilities, I was really curious about the CVSS scores tied to this exploit. For this camera, the buffer overflow relied on custom firmware that the company had built specifically to target these devices. Even so, going through the process step-by-step was super helpful. Hardware exploitation can be tricky — sometimes there are multiple systems or devices connected, which adds complexity. I think I ran through this one at least three times just to really get the flow of it.S</p>

    <ol>
  <li><strong>Reconnaissance & Scanning:</strong> Scanned the network with <code>nmap</code> to enumerate hosts and identify the device running the camera application. Normally, this phase would also involve researching the firmware to plan and execute the exploit, but in this case, the buffer overflow script had already been provided. After finding the IP and seeing a login page, the next step would typically be privilege escalation.</li>
<p></p>
  <li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> The camera was vulnerable to a buffer overflow, which overwrites sections of memory to alter how a program runs. The provided script was specifically crafted for this device, forcing it to reveal its admin credentials.</li>
<p></p>
  <li><strong>Post-Exploitation:</strong> The program crashed — a clear sign the buffer overflow executed successfully. After logging into the device, I gained root access, recovered the admin credentials for the camera, and confirmed full compromise with a “success” banner.</li>
</ol>

    <h4 class="h6">Maritime Village — Day 1</h4>
    <p>This village was crazy!! Drug boats? Crate locks? A Coast Guard cruise boat? And a 20-month-old autonomous surface vessel (you had to provide proof of passport to participate in the CTF)?? And where are the H03s?? (Jk)</p>

    <p>I will say, compared to other villages, the volunteers here were EAGER to talk to you. “Come check this out!” “Wanna know what this boat was?” “Check out our CTF.” They were beyond patient in answering ridiculous questions and loaning equipment. I think I asked the same question five times.</p>

    <p>As much as I wanted to participate, I was severely unprepared. No ethernet dongle, no VM downloaded (nothing adaptable to ARM), and above all, I was mentally struggling after only having three hours of sleep for three days straight.</p>

    <p>So here we go — side quest for hunting down an ethernet dongle and ethernet cord.</p>

    <p>After stumbling across three celebrity goons and several familiar faces from the FloridaMan party, I finally stumbled across the RF Village — obviously someone there was going to have an extra. After chatting with the head organizer, offering some stickers for bribery, and having a quick discussion about what I wanted to accomplish, he agreed to loan me the ethernet dongle.</p>

    <p>Heading back to the Maritime Village, I decided to give the HavocAI CTF a try. I plugged into the network and tried to see what I could find…</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recon:</strong> NMAP on the IP range I was on</li>
      <li><strong>Realization:</strong> Oh shit, what am I looking at..?</li>
    </ul>

<p></p>
    <p><strong>AFS — Andrew File System</strong> is a distributed file system (dating back to the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University), allowing many computers on a network to share files easily, without worrying where the physical file was.</p>

    <p>This file server was listening on UDP port 7000, which is responsible for handling and retrieving actual file data within the AFS structure.</p>

    <p><strong>UPnP — Universal Plug ’n’ Play</strong> is a set of network protocols that enables devices on the same local network to easily discover, connect, and communicate without manual configuration. Think of media sharing, smart home integration, gaming, and VoIP. I can’t quite remember this one because I didn’t delve into it.</p>
      
    <p><strong>Blinking light - </strong> I eventually realized it was morse code. No I did not figure out what message it was sending. </p>  

    <p>By that time, it was the end of the first day of the con.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Maritime Village — Day 2</h4>
    <p>We thought we’d give the village a second try, to mess with the drug boat.</p>

    <p>When I connected to the device, the PCAN protocol immediately populated through USB.</p>

    <p>The setup started with plugging into the interface — PCAN, short for Peak CAN (Controller Area Network), commonly used in automotive and industrial environments. In this case, it was paired with NMEA 2000, the marine networking standard built on the CAN protocol.</p>

    <p>To read the traffic, we needed the right tools, so we downloaded the open-source Canboat utility to identify and pull the serial of the drug boat.</p>

    <p>Once connected, we noticed the interface state showed <code>DOWN</code>. A quick command switched it to <code>UP</code>, and suddenly we could start monitoring the boat’s network traffic. Like any n00b, I captured some signals and ran a replay attack — which, honestly, was pretty exciting.</p>

    <p>Seeing how simple it was to pull this off was eye-opening. So many boats run on NMEA 2000 networks, and the lack of security makes it trivial for someone like me to intercept signals and replay them, potentially manipulating navigation data or creating false readings. It also opens the door to denial-of-service attacks and spoofing — imagine falsifying a vessel’s speed or location.</p>

    <p>NMEA 2000 is notorious for weak authentication and the lack of encryption in its communications.</p>

    <p>All to say, I learned so much at this village. If I didn’t have human body functions and was simply a plant that could live off photosynthesis, I could have easily spent multiple days there. By the end of the second day, though, I found out that most villages would be closed on Day 3 — which, to be fair, made sense.</p>

    <p>And yes — for anyone wondering — I did return that ethernet dongle. The organizer of the RF Village even invited me to join their crew on Discord afterward.</p>

    <p>Funny enough, they thought I’d handed them some random-@ss sticker that wasn’t mine (which, honestly, ouch!), but after Googling my name he realized I was legit. And just like that, I’ll forever be known as the “Dongle Stealer.”</p>

<hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Day 3 — End of the Con</h4>
    <p>I had training this day. I got to make a cool multi-RF tool that can jam Wi-Fi and BLE. They also provided the firmware for taking out drones, but I figure I’d test that another day…</p>

    <p>The trainer of this course worked with Ukrainian troops. He shared his inspiring story of traveling to the front lines and offering his services of RF hacking to Ukrainians, including writing custom firmware for the RF tools we were going to be messing with.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4 class="h6">Key Takeaways and How I Will Apply Them</h4>

    <p><strong>1) Technical Growth:</strong> I now better understand how weak authentication and unencrypted communications can be exploited, and how this knowledge applies to vulnerability management in my daily role. Although this may not directly affect it, seeing these weaknesses demonstrated, showed me how critical weak encryption can be — especially in OT systems like IP cameras, badge scanners, or conference room AV setups that often run outdated TLS, default credentials, or even cleartext traffic. These experiences will help me build better reconnaissance strategies and execute more effective vulnerability assessments.</p>

    <p><strong>2) Networking &amp; Community:</strong> Attending these events helps build connections with industry experts, hackers, and security leaders, expanding my professional network and creating more opportunities for future collaborations. Hearing firsthand experiences from CISOs, SANS authors, and researchers gave me new perspectives on scaling and prioritizing risk, as well as fostering innovation.</p>

      <p><strong>3) Mindset:</strong> This year, I skipped the “wait and watch” approach and jumped straight into the challenges. It taught me to stay calm when I didn’t know something, break problems down step-by-step, and keep moving forward. And yes — it also reminded me there’s no shame in asking an LLM for help; after all, it’s a tool like any other.</p>
    <p><strong>4) Prepping and Planning:</strong> Learning the importance of coming prepared — with the right hardware, VMs, and dongles set up — so I can maximize my time learning and experimenting. Also, realizing the importance of saying “NO” to brain juice. You may be wondering what that is — but considering it’s DEF CON, I was offered this, and I’ll just leave it up to your imagination.</p>
